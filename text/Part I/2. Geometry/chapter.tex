\section{Grassmannian}
Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field. In this section, we will develop the concept of Grassmannian, which gives us a way to find the $27$ lines.

\begin{defn}
	The Grassmannian variety $G(k,n)$\footnote{As a matter of convention, some mathematicians will write it as $G(n,k)$.} for $0\le k \le n$ is defined to be
	\[
		G(n,k)=\{V \text{ subspace of } K^n:\dim V = k\}.
	\]
\end{defn}

In the work of $27$ lines, we will work with $G(2,4)$, which denotes the (projective) lines over the (projective) space.
